1.Spin down sample tubes to make sure there aren't any bubbles on lid
2. Vortex tubes at top speed for two mins
3. Tubes are bubbling intensely after vortexing
4. To tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 mins
5. Add the appropriate amount (volume) of proteinase K and pro K buffer
  -Proteinase K is stored in the -20 in the Putnam lab zymo enzymes box
6. For tubes with 300 microliters add:
   -30 microliters of Pro K buffer
   -15 microliters of Proteinase K
7. Vortex tubes and spin down 
8. Label new 1.5 mL sample tubes with sample ID
9. Remove the liquid from the sample tubes and place into new tubes (helps to set pippette at 400mL
