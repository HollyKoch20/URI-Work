1. Obtain mortar/pestle, scoopula, tweezers, liquid N, samples dried in silica or frozEN, DNA storage tubes with caps, DNA/RNA Shield, ethanol, RNase
2. Wipe down work area and all materils with ethanol and RNase
3. Place a sample in one mortar using tweezers
4. Pour liquid N in a seperate mortar for pouring
5. Pour LN directly on sample
6. Use scoopula or pestle to break down sample
7. After LN2 has evaporated, use the pestle to grind down the sample
8. Place LN2 over the powder-like sample and scrape away the excess off sides
9. Wait for Nitrogen to evaporate 
10. Place dried samples in a DNA Storage tubes with 1mL of DNA/RNA Shield
11. Place samples in a spin column
12. Freeze samples if not extracting
